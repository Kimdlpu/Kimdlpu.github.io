Biography
======
I am currently working as a research scientist at <a href="http://www.shlab.org.cn/">Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory</a>. Before that, I was a postdoctoral fellow in the Chinese University of Hong Kong. 
I obtained my Ph.D. degree in <a href="http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/">Department of Computer Science and Engineering</a>, 
	<a href="http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/">The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)</a> in 2020, supervised by Prof. <a href="http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~pheng" target="_blank">
	Pheng-Ann Heng</a> and Prof. <a href="https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~cwfu/" target="_blank"> Chi-Wing Fu</a>, and obtained my B. Eng. degree in <a href="http://www.scut.edu.cn/cs/">School of Computer Science and Engineering</a>,
	<a href="http://www.scut.edu.cn/new/">South China University of Technology (SCUT)</a> in 2016.


My research interests span computer vision, low-level vision, vision perception, medical AI, and deep learning. Specifically, my research focuses on:
(a) Designing learning algorithms tailored for image and video restoration under challenging weather and lighting conditions.
(b) Specializing in the development of intelligent perception methods capable of continuous operation, with the adaptability to varying environments and diverse lighting scenarios.
(c) Advancing the development of next-generation computer vision models, efficiently handling multiple tasks, and contributing to a deeper understanding of and an enhanced ability to create the visual world.
